The Push bullet sytem never worked for the box, so we used the Pushing inbox .api in order to make it work. The api was set up and can be changed to suit the e-mail of the user, by adding a new scenario, as well as a customised message. When the Buzzer goes off (which has a 5min delay between uses) The yun sends an email to the owner of the box instantly, by going to a webpage with an id token at the end
